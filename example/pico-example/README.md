# Example of Binary Info for the Raspberry Pi Pico

This example shows how to use Binary Info on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

It includes all of the `knurling-rs` tooling as showcased in https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template (`defmt`, `defmt-rtt`, `panic-probe`, `flip-link`) to make development as easy as possible.

`probe-run-rp` is configured as the default runner, so you can start your program as easy as
```
cargo run --release
```

## Requirements
- The standard Rust tooling (cargo, rustup) which you can install from https://rustup.rs/

- Toolchain support for the cortex-m0+ processors in the rp2040 (thumbv6m-none-eabi)

- flip-link - this allows you to detect stack-overflows on the first core, which is the only supported target for now.

- probe-run. Upstream support for RP2040 is not finished yet, so this template uses `probe-run-rp` for now.
  `probe-run-rp` is a version of `probe-run` using a `probe-rs` fork with support for the RP2040 chip.
  Note that this installs the binary with name `probe-run-rp`, so you can still have the original `probe-run` installed in parallel.

  This is important because `probe-run-rp` ONLY works with the RP2040 chip.

- A CMSIS-DAP probe. (JLink probes sort of work but are very unstable. Other probes won't work at all)

  You can use a second Pico as a CMSIS-DAP debug probe by installing the following firmware on it:

  More details on supported debug probes can be found in [debug_probes.md](debug_probes.md)
